# 🛳️ Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous **Titanic dataset**.  
The main goal is to analyze the data, discover hidden patterns, and understand which factors affected the survival of passengers.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset is available on [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).  
It contains information such as:
- Passenger ID
- Age
- Gender
- Class (Pclass)
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarkation port
- Survival status

## 🔍 Steps of Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Converting categorical data into numerical form  

2. **Data Visualization**  
   - Using histograms, bar plots, and pie charts  
   - Survival distribution by **gender**, **class**, and **age**  

3. **Feature Insights**  
   - Female passengers had higher survival rates  
   - First-class passengers survived more than others  
   - Age played a significant role
